## Introduction
Rummy is a card game in which players form valid combinations of cards called **melds**. The objective is to arrange all your cards into sets and sequences before your opponents.

- **Players:** 2-4 players can participate.

### Setup
1. Each player is dealt **13** cards.
2. The remaining cards form the **draw pile**.
3. The top card is placed face up as the **discard pile**.

### Gameplay
Each turn consists of (order required):
1. **Drawing a card**
2. **Forming melds** (if possible)
3. **Discarding a card**
